##description

The assignment required me to use my knowledge of html and css to create a portfolio website. It required understanding of creating the skeleton of a website (html) and then create body using CSS. I found as I was learning how to add images and background colours, trying to understand padding and margins, CSS Grid and Flex, that I realised I had to do a lot of work and research in my own time to truly grasp it. After doing this for the second time, as my first attempt wasn't too great, I really feel a lot more confident about my abilities in using CSS - especially CSS Grid and Flex which had baffled me before I did my own research. The purpose of this website was to showcase my skills and I feel quite satisfied with what I have produced on my second attempt.
